### Applying the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) in the Programming 2 class at the Technological Institute of the Americas (ITLA) with two main exercises:

### Purpose of the Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Refactoring for the Open/Closed Principle

#### Objective:
Apply the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) to ensure software entities are open for extension but closed for modification.

#### Description:

+ Refactor a basic class structure for online and offline courses.
+ Implement interfaces and abstract classes to define contracts and use dependency injection.
+ Facilitate the addition of new functionalities without altering existing code.

#### Exercise 2: Adding a New Subscription Type

#### Objective:
Extend the system to handle a new subscription type (hybrid courses) while following the Open/Closed Principle.

#### Description:

+ Create a new hybrid subscription service combining online and offline courses.
+ Implement a HybridCourse class using the new hybrid subscription service.
+ Ensure no modifications are made to OnlineCourse and OfflineCourse.
+ Verify the implementation with a client code to manage course subscriptions correctly.

### General Summary
These exercises aim to reinforce understanding and application of the Open/Closed Principle, ensuring code is extensible and maintainable without modifying existing classes. This is crucial for developing robust and adaptable software.
